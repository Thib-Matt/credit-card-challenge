# credit-card-challenge

Project on a dataset of credit card transactions. The dataset contains 8500 customers and their activity over a 6-month period. 
Each transaction is characterized by 18 features.

The task is to find the most useful customer segmentation to improve the marketing campaigns of the company.

2 python files in the main folder:

- credit_card_challenge_clustering.ipynb: "unsupervised learning" part of the project. It contains different approaches 
to build the clusters using several algorithm and dimensionality reduction. As an output we get a new csv file with the labels
assigned to each customer

- credit_card_challenge_analysis.ipynb: 2nd part of the project that consists in analysing the different clusters and find a meaning 
of the customers' segmentation.
